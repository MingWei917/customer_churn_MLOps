## Overview

This project implements a **production-grade MLOps pipeline** for customer churn prediction using:

- **GitHub** (PR-based workflow)
- **DVC** (data & model versioning)
- **MLflow** (experiment tracking & model registry)
- **DagsHub** (remote storage & UI)
- **GitHub Actions** (CI/CD)

---

## Pipeline Flow
raw → preprocess → feature → split → train → evaluate → gate


Each stage is:

- **Reproducible** (DVC)
- **Traceable** (MLflow)
- **Validated** (CI + validation gate)

---

## Key Guarantees

- No unvalidated model reaches `main`
- Every metric is reproducible
- Every model is traceable to **data + code**
- Rollback is always possible

---
